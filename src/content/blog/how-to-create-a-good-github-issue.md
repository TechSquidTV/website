One of the main benefits of working in modern open source code, is community interaction. It's how we learn, grow, and contribute to better and free software. Over the last four years, I lead a team of three developers building out and maintaining over 70 open source projects.

It was barely a secret that the better prepared the issue was prepared, the faster we respond to the issue, regardless of age. The more concise information available, the faster the maintainers or community can respond. So, let's talk about how you can help others help you with GitHub Issues.

## When Should You Create an Issue?

In the world of open source, we're fortunate to have access to software crafted through the dedication and hard work of countless individuals. These contributors generously donate their time and expertise to create something truly valuable for all of us, free of charge. Before creating an issue, I encourage you to take an extra moment to do some due diligence and take some steps to help others help you.

## What To Do Before Creating an Issue

### Check the Documentation

Before creating an issue, make sure you've thoroughly read the project documentation. Many projects may have multiple sources of information, such as formal documentation as well as additional guides or tutorials. If you're not sure where to start, check the project's README, wiki, or documentation.

### Read Contributor Guidelines

Most well-maintained open-source projects will have a [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors#about-contributing-guidelines) file, usually in the root of the project or possibly in the `.github` directory. This file is a starting point for interacting with any open source project. It will typically include instructions for how to best contribute to that specific project, from submitting pull requests, to creating issues.

### Search for Similar Issues

Most contributor guidelines will request you perform a search to make sure the issue hasn't already been created. If you've searched, and the issue has already been created, you can join the conversation and add any information you may have and help others gain insights on the issue.

You may also find that a similar issue was created in the past and closed already. Either closed with a solution or a possibly a reason for the behavior.
