Unit-Testing Bash is something I never considered was even possible, nor did it cross my mind how critical Bash scripts often are often going un-tested. If you are in the semi-rare situation where you are publishing Bash scripts to production, you may want to pay attention.¬†The rest of you are reading, I assume for shock value.

In my day job, I create CI integrations for a large CI platform, mostly in Bash. Bash is extremely portable, running on most Linux distributions and mostly compatible with MacOS. A more common scenario might be deploying shell scripts to Ansible, or distributing bash scripts directly like [CodeCov's Bash Uploader](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/about-the-codecov-bash-uploader)(_until recently_).

## BATS-Core Bash Automated Testing System

BATS-Core Git Repository: https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core

> Bats is a [TAP](https://testanything.org/)-compliant testing framework for Bash. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected.

If you are already familiar with unit-testing in languages like JavaScript, you may be familiar with basic testing frameworks such as [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). These unit-testing frameworks take "assertions" and execute them to validate your code.

## Writing Testable Bash Scripts

If you haven't written a lot of Bash in the past, you've probably written fairly linear scripts, without functions, all in a single file. For small scripts that may be find but let's take a look at how we can write our Bash in a way that's manageable and testable.

There are two main ways to approach writing testable Bash:

1. Write small single-purpose scripts that could be executed in sequential order.
2. Create a "main" script, and define "functions" in one or more dependency scripts.

In this tutorial, we are going to go with option two and define functions in a separate file. Option two is a little more simple for testing, and most folks are unaware you can even write functions in Bash.

Start a new directory and create two files: `main.sh` and `functions.sh`.

```shell
$ mkdir <some/directory/for/this>
$ touch main.sh
$ touch functions.sh
```

`main.sh` will act as the "root" of our Bash "application". It will load all of the functions we write in `functions.sh`.

## Writing Functions

Let's create a function that will take in two numbers and add them together, then echo the result.

There are multiple syntaxes to write a function in shell, but we'll stick with this.

```bash title="functions.sh"
#!/bin/sh

addNumbers() {
  echo $(($1+$2))
}

addNumbers 1 2
```

When we run `./functions.sh` from the shell, we'll get back `3`.

```shell
$ . ./functions.sh
3
```

We can't use `()` parentheses in functions to pass arguments in the same way we do in most programming languages, the parentheses are just decorative. We can however, pass arguments to our function the same way you can any shell executable.

The `$0`¬†variable contains the current shell, and each numeric value above that corresponds to each argument passed in.

Now, we don't actually want our `functions.sh` file to execute, we only want it to contain the functions we want to call in `main.sh`, and test. So, let's remove the `addNumbers 1 2`

```bash title="functions.sh"
#!/bin/sh

addNumbers() {
  result=$(($1+$2))
  echo $result
}
```

Let's add one more example to our `functions.sh` file, another function that will square the input.

```bash title="functions.sh"
#!/bin/sh

addNumbers() {
  result=$(($1+$2))
  echo $result
}

squareResult() {
  result=$(($1*$1))
  echo $result
}
```

We have here two functions, but we can't yet do anything with them. So let's open up `main.sh` and add the following code:

```bash title="main.sh"
#!/bin/sh
. functions.sh
sum=$(addNumbers 1 2)
squareResult $sum
```

`source` is a Bash built-in command that will load and execute a file in the current shell. It's a common way to load in function, environment variables, constants, or run other scripts.

`source` and `.` are equivalent.

Once the functions have been loaded, we can now call them from `main.sh`. In this example, we store the result of `addNumbers 1 2` in `sum`, and then we call `squareResult` on `$sum`.

When we run `./main.sh` from the shell, we'll get back `9`.

```shell
$ source ./main.sh
9
```

We now have a relatively simple and easy to read `main.sh` file which has had the main logic abstracted away in `functions.sh`.

Now, how do we ensure the integrity of our script(s) in the future. If someone were to make a pull request that modified our BASH scripts, we'd want to ensure that the changes are tested before we commit them.

## Installing BATS

Now that you've had a mico-crash-course on writing Bash functions, let's take a look at testing our new Bash script using the [BATS-Core Bash Automation Testing System](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core#run-test-other-commands).

First, install BATS-Core. There are a number of different installation options, including Homebrew, NPM, or you can install from the source directly.

```shell
# Install BATS-Core
$ git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
$ cd bats-core
$ ./install.sh /usr/local
```

or

```shell
# Install BATS-Core via NPM
$ npm install -g bats
```

Run `bats -v` to verify the installation.

## Write Tests

First up to create our tests, create a tests directory right next to our shell scripts.

```shell
üìÅ tests/
 |--- tests.bats
üìÑ functions.sh
üìÑ main.sh
```

After we complete writing our tests, we will simply give BATS the path to this directory and each¬†`.bats` test file will be executed, with each test case within being evaluated.

You can think of each file as a test suite containing a number of tests.

A `.bat` file is nothing more than a simple bash script with some fancy syntax sugar that allows us to write tests in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of a testing framework in other programming languages, but there isn't much actual magic happening behind the scenes.

Let's write our first test case.

```bash title="tests.bats"
#!/usr/bin/env bats
@test "addNumbers 5 + 3 | expect 8" {
  run addNumbers 5 3
  echo "result: ${output}"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = 8 ]
}
```

Now don't go running anything yet, there is an issue we'll need to take care of but let's check out what we have.

`@test` is a special syntax for BATS which is nothing more than a wrapper for a standard shell function. The first "_argument_" here is the test description/name and within this function is your test code. BATS will automatically iterate each test case and report back the results individually, we'll take a look at that soon.

What runs within this test case is any valid bash code. If a _non-zero_ status code is returned during this test it will be considered a failure. So we want to execute some code within this test and ensure a non-zero exit code is raised if we see unexpected behavior.

Additionally, BATS comes with another special helper function `run` which will execute the given command and quietly store the exit status code and any output to the variables `status` and `output`. Using `run`, we can specifically test for expected exit codes in our test cases.

Here, we are testing our "`addNumbers`" function by passing it two known values and comparing the output. If we feed in to our function the numbers '`5`' and '`3`', we expect to get back '`8`' echoed to standard output.

And of course, before actually checking the output, we first check to ensure that we got a successful `0` exit code.

You can read about `run` and other built-in functions on the [documentation here](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core#run-test-other-commands).

```bash title="tests.bats"
run addNumbers 5 3
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = 8 ]
```

In this test, we expect no issues so we check to ensure `$status` is equal to zero (`0`). We also know that the result echoed to standard output, which is recorded by the run function under $output. So, we will also test for the output, which we expect to be equal to `8`.

This one test now checks two conditions to be considered valid.

Now I mentioned a moment ago, we aren't quite done yet, we haven't actually imported our functions yet.

We're going to add a `setup` function to our BATS tests, which is another special function that will run before every one of our tests. Here, we will load in our functions from `functions.sh`.

```bash title="tests.bats"
#!/usr/bin/env bats

setup() {
  . ./functions.sh
}

@test "addNumbers 5 + 3 | expect 8" {
  run addNumbers 5 3
  echo "result: ${output}"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = 8 ]
}
```

We're just about done, but for the sake the example, since we have two functions, let's add a second test case to our `tests.bats` file for the squareResult function.

**Final test.bats**

```bash title="tests.bats"
#!/usr/bin/env bats

setup() {
  . ./functions.sh
}

@test "addNumbers 5 + 3 | expect 8" {
  run addNumbers 5 3
  echo "result: ${output}"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = 8 ]
}


@test "squareResult 3 | expect 9" {
  run squareResult 3
  echo "result: ${output}"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = 9 ]
}
```

Run `bats <directory>` to execute the tests

<script
  id="asciicast-LQbYYy7h5IYlNu0pzG11Ji2MR"
  src="https://asciinema.org/a/LQbYYy7h5IYlNu0pzG11Ji2MR.js"
  async
></script>

## Conclusion

That's really all there is to it! Go forth and write clean and testable bash scripts!

Consider running your tests automatically though a CI provider, or adding a git pre-commit hook to ensure that your scripts are tested before you commit them.

As a final thought, I considered "What if you want to ship a single script, rather than the two `main.sh` and `functions.sh` scripts?". Well, a quick StackOverflow search for the correct `sed` command later and we have a solution.

You can create a `package.sh` file that will replace the line that sources our functions, with the contents of the `functions.sh` file instead.

```bash title="package.sh"
# Inject the functions directly into the main.sh file
# Useful for production.
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/49438

sed -e '/. functions.sh/ {' -e 'r functions.sh' -e 'd' -e '}' -i main.sh
```

This will produce a `main.sh` file that can be shipped as a single script.
