# TechSquidTV Website - Open Source Portfolio and Blog

## Introduction

Hello üëã! My name is [Kyle Tryon](https://github.com/KyleTryon), also known as TechSquidTV. This is my open-source blog and portfolio, where I document and share my developer journey as a "self-taught" developer, now in the industry over half a decade, and as a content creator. This is the "third" reincarnation of my website (Wordpress ‚û°Ô∏è NuxtJS ‚û°Ô∏è Astro), built on [Astro.build](https://astro.build) using _mostly_ vanilla TypeScript and TailwindCSS.
